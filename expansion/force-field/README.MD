# CombatLogX Expansion: Force Field

The force field expansion shows a border around protected non-pvp areas. You must have at least one compatibility
expansion to use the force field.

## Disclaimers:

- The force field is a nice visual effect that shows players areas they cannot enter.
- The force field should not be used as entry prevention, as players can just ignore the fake block packets that are
  sent to them.
- For the actual entry prevention options, please check the configuration for your region expansion (e.g. WorldGuard
  Compatibility).
- If your server has weak hardware, or you have a lot of players online, we recommend disabling the force field effect.
- You can try unsafe mode and see if performance improves, but the most recommended option is to disable the force
  field.
